/*

Types In Js

Primitive => data that only a single value
* number => 4
* string => 'hello'
* boolean => true / false
* undefined
* null // but if we do typeof it will give you object
* Symbol('Hy there') => symbol // new type with es6

Non Primitive
* object => {}
* [] => object
* function(){} => will show function but under the hood its an object


diff btw null and undefined

undefined is absence of defination
null is absence of value
